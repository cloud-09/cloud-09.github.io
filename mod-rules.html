        How to lose your mod position
    </h1>
â€‹    <ul>
        <li>
            If I see you as unfit to be a mod I will unmod you, I give everyone a fair chance. I give temp positions until I see you have proven yourself. If time passes and I have saw that you haven't been active or helping you are cut. Also I know you all know this but, follow rules on page one.
			</li>
			<li>
				Please do not overuse your power meaning:  Do not ban people for no reason, Please tell me who you ban and why you did. Don't ban someone who you just don't like. I will give you permission to ban someone if they are rude beyond belief. (Calling you names insulting you).
			</li>
			<li>
				PLEASE DO NOT FAVOR. There are many chats I have been to that favor others, do not favor a friend or a boyfriend/girlfriend. Others will see it as unfair and bitch. Please do not let your friends or lovers get away with breaking rules.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are having trouble with another mod, or what they are doing, please send me screen shots and what is going on.
			</li>
			<li>
				Please tell me, when you ban someone and, why. I NEED to be updated on these things, so I can't stress this enough.
			</li>
			<li>
				PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I modded you because I need your help watching the rooms, giving ideas to keep people entertained or, just keeping an eye on people. Don't leave for a month without telling me and then come back and expect to still be mod. AT LEAST TELL ME, so I can have someone fill your place temp.
			</li>
			<li>
				YOU CAN QUIT AT ANYTIME AS YOU PLEASE. Or if you switch account and, make a new one your main also tell me.
			</li>
			<li>
				DO NOT GIVE OUT THE PASSWORD FOR MOD RULES.  IT'S COMMON SENSE.
			</li>
			<li>
				BANS ARE BANS PERIOD. If we need to discuss the rules, or have a meeting to discuss a ban or other purposes, a mod spot for the room is btmmodsite.chatango.com . Only mods can post their.
			</li>
			<li>
				Either than that please INVITE OTHER PEOPLE  and help me keep the room alive! I'm counting on you guy's.
			</li>
