    <h1>
        Hello, and Welcome, Moderators
    </h1>
    First, congratulations on becoming a moderator!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a few simply things we need moderators to do aside from monitoring the chatroom and resolving incidents in accordance with the <a href="rules.html">these guidelines</a>. Please try to recruit new people to the room when you have time and, in particular, be sure to greet new comers as they come in. We want everyone to feel welcome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here are a few other things you should understand about the role:
â€‹    <ul>
        <li>
            Mod-ship is a responsibility, not a privilege. Do not abuse the power.
            <br/>
            I.e.: Do not ban people without proper warning, or delete posts without proper reason (If someone is causing trouble but it's difficult to pin them for an individual event of action, we'll need to discuss it and come up with a solution).
        </li>
        <li>
            Generally, new moderators are on temporary or trial positions until they demonstrate their suitability to the role.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to the more obvious way of losing your position (rule breaking or other bad behaviour), moderators will also be removed if they are no longer frequently visiting the room, or aren't being helpful, or just aren't needed.
            <br/>
            I.e. if we find we have too many mods or more mods than we need we may shorten the list at our discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must make your best effort to remain impartial at all times.
            <br/>
            This may include asking another moderator to handle the situation/ban decision at times when you are personally offended or aggrivated by a visitor, if another moderator is available.
        </li>
        <li>
            As goes for normal visitors, if you have a problem with another moderator's actions (or an admin/owner), please discuss it in PMs or the mod channel with that mod/admin and/or another admin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please try to keep both owners updated on events/actions that involve a ban or other direct invention when they occur by leaving us messages telling us who was banned and why, including screenshots.
        </li>
        <li>
            If something is happening that may prevent you from attending the room or performing your duties (such as a holiday or new job), please inform us so that we can ensure the room is still properly monitored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Under no circumstances is any moderator allowed to reverse a decision made by another staff member without first discussing it with and getting the approval of the decision maker or an admin. This will not be tolerated.
            <br/>
            E.g. Don't casually unban a visitor who was banned whilst you were asleep just because /you/ trust the visitor.
		</ul>
