	<h1>Rules</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Don't be an asshole.
			<br/>
			If you cannot avoid being an asshole, you're too immature to be here anyway.
			<br/>
			As a rule-of-thumb: No racism, homophobia, religion bashing or any other kind of prejudicial hate towards an individual group of people, no bullying, and no trolls.
		</li>
		<li>
			Do not spam or flood.
			<br/>
			As a rule-of-thumb: if you have any more than 5 messages in a row or your messages take up most of the screen, you should probably slow down.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <strong style="color:rgb(37, 170, 225);text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px black, 0px 0px 2px rgb(37, 170, 225), 0px 0px 0.5em rgb(37, 170, 225);">Blue</strong> channel is for normal RP. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Any NSWF content (i.e. images) MUST go in the <strong style="color:rgb(237, 28, 36);text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px black, 0px 0px 2px rgb(237, 28, 36), 0px 0px 0.5em rgb(237, 28, 36);">Red</strong> channel.
			<br/>
			<strong>Note:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The only porn permitted is hentai. "Live-Action" porn is strictly forbidden.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can't actually cyber/have full-on sex in the public room:
					<br/>
					Flirting, as well as limited teasing or foreplay may be permitted but you will eventually be forced to take it to PMs. (At moderator discretion)
					<br/>
					As a rule-of-thumb: once you decide to really "go at it", or start getting graphic about genitals, start moving to PMs.
				</li> 
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Keep drama out of the chat. This means:
			<ul>
				<li>
					No fighting, and no harrassment.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please avoid bringing up personal problems or problems outside of the room within the chat.
					<br/>
					This includes self-loathing, as well fishing for compliments.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do not complain about the actions of another visitor or moderator in the public chat. If there is a problem. PM a moderator, and we'll try and help you out.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			No advertising, no shock sites, no malware. ANY links to other rooms, porn sites or viruses WILL be permanently and instantly banned.
		</li>
		<li>
			Please listen to, and be respectful towards moderators, and refrain from arguing with or complaining about moderation decisions in the public chat.
			<br/>
			This means: 
			<ul>
				<li>
					If a mod tells you to stop something, you stop. If their request was unreasonable, resolve it in PMs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Disputing an official moderator request in public is trolling. PM us instead, so that it won't disrupt everyone else. This includes comments like "But I didn't do anything wrong!" or "That's not fair!".
				</li>
				<li>
					"Drop it" also means "Pretend it didn't happen for a while".
					<br/>
					Alluding to or referencing to the an argument in ANY WAY is as bad as continuing the argument.
				</li>
				<li>
					Just because you weren't originally participating in the argument doesn't excuse you.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#tempBan">Temporary Bans</a> may be issued if any moderator has recently issued any warning (formal or informal) in relation to this rule, without further warning.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><em>There is no excuse</em></strong>. You have been warned.
				</li>
			</ul> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Moderation Guidelines (What to expect from us)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li id="tempBan">
			Temporary Bans - of approximately 10 minutes may be applied without warning in order to quickly shut down fights and other drama.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Temporary bans are not a form of punishment in and of themselves.
				</li>
				<li>
					They neither require, nor count towards warnings for extended bans. However, you may recieve a formal warning at the same time if you are misbehaving.
				</li>
				<li>
					Yes, you might receive a temporary ban mistakenly, if so, PM the moderator, and they'll sort it out ASAP, please be patient. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Any moderator has discretion to shorten or lift a temporary ban at any time. (Within reason)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Each user will recieve at least 3 formal warnings before receiving an extended ban (does not include 10 minute bans). 
		</li>
		<li>
			In general, extended bans will apply for the following durations, in order: First ban is 1 day, second ban is 2-3 days, third ban is permanent.
			<br/>
			However, these are just guides, and specific penalties are at the discretion of the acting moderator(s). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Complaints or problems with moderator decisions or behaviour will ONLY be handled in PMs. Be it with that mod, or another. Discussing these matters in the room will NOT be tolerated. 
		</li>
		<li>
			We are here to maintain a pleasant and welcoming mood and atmosphere in the room, not just to enforce the rules. We may take action against acts that aren't yet covered by the rules. Within reason.
		</li>
	</ul>
